'''This is a custom layout for the RPi InfoScreen wordclock screen.

    Custom layouts can be created for the screen by creating a new file in the
    "layouts" folder.

    Each layout must have the following variables:
        LAYOUT:   The grid layout. Must be a single string.
        MAP:      The mapping required for various times (see notes below)
        COLS:     The number of columns required for the grid layout
        SIZE:     The size of the individual box containing your letter.
                  Tuple in (x, y) format.
        FONTSIZE: Font size for the letter

# Map instructions:
# The clock works by rounding the time to the nearest 5 minutes.
# This means that you need to have settings for each five minute interval "m00"
# "m00", "m05".
# The clock also works on a 12 hour basis rather than 24 hour:
# "h00", "h01" etc.
# There are three optional parameters:
#   "all": Anything that is always shown regardless of the time e.g. "It is..."
#   "am":  Wording/symbol to indicate morning.
#   "pm":  Wording/symbol to indicate afternoon/evening
